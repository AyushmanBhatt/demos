    <h2>IDs and Classes in HTML</h2>
    <!--The ID is an identifier which must be unique in the whole HTML document. It is used to find an element while linking, scripting, or styling.-->
    <!--Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements.-->
    <div id="mainBox" class="redBg">This is the main</div>
    <!-- IDs refer to giving a name to any particular element for its identity. It simply refers giving an identity to an element. We know, no two names can be given to any of the two members of the family. In the same way, one ID can be given to only one element on a website. Therefore, in the below example, the id mainBox cannot be given to any other element. -->
    <span class="redBg"></span>
    <!-- Select and press ctrl + / to comment -->
    <!-- Emmet -->
    <!-- . is for class and # is for id -->
    <span class="redBg"></span>
    <span id="mainSpan"></span>
    <div class="redBg blackBorder anotherClass"></div>

    <!-- Emmet takes div tag as default -->
    <div class="blackBackground"></div>

    <!-- Creating multiple elements using Emmet -->
    <!-- span.myClass.myClass2.myClass3*4 + <Tab> to print 4 similar elements using Emmet -->
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">First</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Second</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Third</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Fourth</span>
</body>

<!-- Now the question arises what is the need for an ID in HTML? The answer is, while using JavaScript or CSS, we can target one full element and can make the necessary changes in it. In the same way, we can grab the full element and change the border or width or many more things through CSS. -->

<!-- One point to note here is we can assign only one ID to a particular element but it is not so in the case of classes. An element can have more than one class in itself. The more classes we add in an element, the more property will get added to it. -->
